# Game server UI

This react js project uses `.env` file to store some variables. Basically, you just need to copy `.env.example` and update accordingly to your needs.

If you want to run app locally `npm run start` and `.env.local` file.

And `env.staging` if you want to use docker-compose from the root of the project.
